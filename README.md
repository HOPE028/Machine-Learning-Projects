# Machine Learning Projects

## About

After following CodeCademys *Build a Machine Learning Model with Python*, I created a multitude of different models to predict various things using  Python 3, SKLearn, Panda, Numpy, and MatPlotLib.

## What

- A **Python** file containing the model and code. 
- **.json** files holding the data required to train and test the model
- A **.txt** explaining what machine learning algorithm is being used, what it is predicting, and its accuracy.

## Dependencies

To download and execute the files, you must have:
- Python 3
- SKLearn
- Panda
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib.
